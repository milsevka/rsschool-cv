# Code example
Lottery Ticket! KATA from Codewars:Time to win the lottery!
Given a lottery ticket (ticket), represented by an array of 2-value arrays, you must find out if you've won the jackpot.

    function bingo(ticket, win){
    let res = 0
    for (let i = 0; i < ticket.length; i++) {
    let z = ticket[i][1]  
    let l = String.fromCharCode(z)
    if (ticket[i][0].includes(l)){
    res++ 
    }
    }
    if (res >= win) {
    return 'Winner!'
    } return 'Loser!'
    }
